Tendu is the common abbreviation for battement tendu and often used in preparation for larger movements like grand battement."

To do a frappé, the dancer usually starts with the outside leg in a flexed, turned out position lifted off the floor with the heel placed slightly above the ankle bone of the standing leg.  The dancer then extends her leg and points her foot, towards the floor and out, causing the “strike” on the floor.  The strike on the floor is exactly how the step got its name, since frappé actually means “struck” or to strike. The term is also used to describe a whole set of steps at the barre, usually called a “frappé combination,” that is usually done as one of the last exercises at barre after a dancer’s muscles have become warm."

      "description": "Port de bras is a classical ballet term meaning movement of the arms. It describes how dancers move their arms from one position to another. For example, if a ballerina moves her arms from first position to fifth position, that is considered a port de bras. When doing proper port de bras, dancers will move their arms from their back and shoulders (without lifting the shoulders awkwardly upwards) while trying to move as smoothly as possible. The shape of the arms should be rounded so there is no visible break at the elbows and wrists. In classical ballet, the arms should never be fully straight or hyper-extended at the elbows. Also, the hands should be shaped with the fingers extended running mostly in the same direction, but not stuck together like a paddle or overly extended."

A dancer performs a grand battement by throwing the working leg into the air from the hip and brings it back down to a position, typically fifth position.  While doing a grand battement a dancer keeps both legs straight while the rest of the body remains relatively still. A grand battement is very important for grande allegro, allowing a dancer to jump higher when performed correctly."

The supporting (standing) leg can be straight or in a demi-plié. Arabesque can be performed in several variations: first, second, third or fourth arabesque. The variations are based on the position of the arms which create the longest line from the fingers to the toes."

      "description": "Pirouette is a classical ballet term meaning spin. It describes when a dancer is turning around one leg with the other off the ground and in a position, most commonly in passé.  A pirouette can be done either en dedans, turning in towards the supporting leg that the dancer is turning on, or en dehors, which is turning away from the supporting leg. Pirouettes are often considered one of the most fun ballet steps to practice and do.  Also, since they are quite hard to do cleanly with multiple turns (double pirouettes, triple pirouettes and so on) it becomes very rewarding for dancers once they feel they’ve improved their pirouettes.  A pirouette can come in many different forms since it basically describes any turn, that is done on one leg.  A pirouette, while close in defintion, is not done with a piqué, but with a relevé despite the definitions of pirouette and pique turn being similar."

      "typeOfMovement": "Turn",
      "description": "A pirouette en dedans is a classical ballet term that describes a pirouette turning inward toward the standing leg.  For example, if a dancer is turning on the right leg, the dancer will be turning to the right in an en dedans pirouette. Pirouettes en dedans are an intermediate ballet step but very commonly seen in all types of dance in school and professional performances.  This is because a pirouette en dedans basically describes any turn that is turning “inward” toward the standing leg.  It can be thought of the opposite of an en dehors pirouette, where you’re turning away. The most common type of pirouette en dedans is with the dancer in a retiré position with the arms in first or high fifth position.  However, there are many other forms too.  For example, you may see a dancer perform an attitude pirouette en dedans, or possibly an arabesque pirouette en dedans.  Those two pirouettes, as you may have guessed, have the dancing turning inward toward the front foot while in a attitude or arabesque position."

      "description": "An assemblé in classical ballet has many different variations, but the basics are always the same: two legs joining together in the air. In a basic form, an assemblé is when one foot slides along the floor before brushing into the air.  As the foot goes into the air, the dancer then jumps by pushing into and off the floor with the supporting leg and foot.  The supporting leg now meets with the other leg in the air and “assembles” into a fifth position.  The dancer then lands on the floor with a plié in fifth position."

      "description": "A Temps Levé is a type of jump from one foot, landing on the same foot while the other leg is raised in a position in the air. In this, the raised leg is in Arabesque. An Arabesque describes the position where the dancer has one leg stretched directly behind them. The Arabesque that is demonstrated is a First Arabesque. Arabesques are defined by the position of the arms. A First Arabesque is where the dancer has the arm on the same side as the supporting leg (in this case, the leg doing the jumping) extended in front and the other arm to the side. This is a common step executed by both male and female dancers."

It is a very common and popular ballet step, seen in performances and throughout classes of most skill levels. A sissonne in its most simplest form is commonly taught to students at intermediate levels as part of medium and grande allegro. Many pictures featuring dancers in splits in mid-air are commonly pictures of a sissonne."
