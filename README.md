### Make My Developpe


## Ballet Training and Progress Tracker

# Description: 
  I created this app that allows a user to build a virtual library of ballet training workouts, as well as track their progress via image uploads and reference a glossary of ballet terms.

# Purpose:
  When Covid-19 hit, our youngest daughterâ€™s dance studio was closed. This left her training at home, mostly on her own, for months. During this time, she struggled to create, write out and keep track of her own ballet training workouts. 


# To run this code:
  1. Clone it down

  2. Go to your terminal of choice and create a new folder
  
  3. Copy the SSH key in git hub
  
  4. In your terminal write: git clone git@github.com:KelleyCrittenden/Make-My-Developpe.git

  5. Launch from Terminal

  6. cd into make-my-developpe

  7. npm install

  8. npm start *If doesn't open automatically then paste http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
